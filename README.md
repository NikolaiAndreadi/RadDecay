# RadDecay
Old project - find the activity of each radionuclide of large decay chains

Usage/info:

    Run RD.exe and wait for a summary of the elapsed time and the number of steps. After that, your out.dat file will be ready 
    for further analysis.

    input/input.dat - initial data

    output/out.dat - results, table of radioactive activity

    output/outmass.dat - results, table of mass

    db/Elements.ini - pairs of element name and its charge

    db/isotopes.ini - isotope data. Make sure that analyzed isotopes and all of its daughter nuclides are specified in this file
